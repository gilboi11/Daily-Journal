Started the development of the map module using different approaches that would:
1. Have the most optimum efficiency 
2. Look most visually appealing
3. Did not disrupt flow of program
Returned to conceptualization after reviewing suggestions from project manager
Fahad suggested using control boxes/picture boxes and positioning them in maps where they would be most efficient in displaying directions
Marvin suggested the arrows should shift each with its own value
Gil suggested putting a number value in the rooms where it would be read and also in the control boxes--Djikstra's method shortest path available
